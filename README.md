# 🧹 The Dungeon Cleaner

**The Dungeon Cleaner** is a reverse Sokoban puzzle game where you *drag* boxes back to their original positions instead of pushing them.

You play as a dungeon janitor restoring order one box at a time — drag every box to its colored tile, then walk back to your starting point.
